# Portfolio-assignment
The code that has been used here is basically HTML. CSS has been added to bring in the styling element
This portfolio is created by myself. This is in an attempt to learn how to use CSS.
## Description
In order to create my personal portfolio, I wanted it to appear in form of a website. I first created a folder in my documents that I named Moringa-school-projects. Under this folder, I then created the portfolio.html and portfolio.css files
I ensured that the wbsite I am creating has my profile photo and a background image.
Using the different styling elements, such as float, text decoration and color, I managed to create this simple personal portfolio page.
There is no application to download in order to run this code. As long as one has any browser, one is able to open this site.
Also, there are no known bugs in executing this code as it doesn't require any prior installation of an application before accessing the website.
The language I have used here is purely HTML and CSS.
I am looking at being a web developer, hence, for any collaboration, one can contact me through my email address, esiranjo@gmail.com
