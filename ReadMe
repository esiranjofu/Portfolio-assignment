# My Portfolio
#### My First Portfolio, 03/12/2021
#### By **Emily Siranjofu**
## Description
The code that has been used here is basically HTML. CSS has been added to bring in the styling element. Using the different styling elements, such as float, text decoration and color, I managed to create this simple personal portfolio page.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Create a repository in the local machine.
* I initialized the repo using the command git init.
* To confirm that I have initialized this, I used the command ls .a
* Using my command line interface application, I created the two files, namely portfolio.html and portfolio.css
* I opened these two files using the visual studio code.
* To link the two files, I use the command <link rel="stylesheet" href="../CSS/portfolio.css" type="text/css" media="all">
* For any changes made on the these files, upon saving, one has to commit them. To do so, first you stage the changes using the command git add .
* Commit the changes using the command git commit -m "message"
* To confirm that the commits are successful, one uses the command git log.
* To link the local repo to the remote repo, use the command git remote add origin.
* To confirm if one has linked the local and remote repo, use the command git remote -v
* Push the commit to the remote repo using the command git push.
## Known Bugs
Also, there are no known bugs in executing this code as it doesn't require any prior installation of an application before accessing the website.
## Technologies Used
To get all this done, I have mainly worked with html and CSS.  Currently, there are no other codes this program is running on apart from executing it using the visul studio code. If you run into trouble while using visual studio, one has the alternative to use atom. Of importance to note is that there is no application to download in order to run this code. As long as one has any browser, one is able to open this site.
